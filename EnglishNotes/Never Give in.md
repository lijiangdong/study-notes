# Never Give in

Almost a year has passed since I came down here at your Head Master's kind invitation in order to cheer myself and cheer the hearts of a few of my friends by singing some of our own songs.

The ten months that have passed have seen very terrible catastrophic events in the world---up and downs,misfortune---but can anyone sitting here this afternoon,this October afternoon, not feel deeply thankful for what has happened in the time that just passed and for the very great improvement in the position of our country and of our home?

Why,when I was here last time we were quite alone,desperately alone,and we had been so for five or six months.We were poorly armed. We are not poorly armed today;but then we were very poor armed.We had the unmeasured menace of the enemy and their air attack still beating upon us,and you yourselves had had experienced of this attack; and I expect you are beginning to feel impatient that there has been this long lull with nothing particular turning up!

You cannot tell from appearances how things will go. Sometimes imagination makes things our far worse than they are; yet without imagination not much can be done.Those people who are imaginative see many more dangers than perhaps exist;certainly many more than will happen;but then they must also pray to be given that courage to carry this far-reaching imagination.
