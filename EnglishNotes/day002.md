Marshmallow Test hitherto remains one of the most famous piece of social-science research:

Put a marshmallow in front of a child, told her that she can have another marshmallow if she can go 15 minutes without eating this marshmallow.

Whether she is patient enough to get the double hortation is supposedly regarded as an indicative signal of a willpower that will pay dividends down the line at campus and eventually at work.

Why does this test have such a critical significance even can predict one’s future, because the child’s decision is closely bound up with a sort of index called patience of which immense amount of parents are unware.

【答案】
棉花糖测试迄今为止是社科研究中最有名的部分之一：在一个小孩子面前放一个棉花糖，告诉她，如果她15分钟不吃，就会再给她一个。

她是否足够耐心从而使自己的奖励翻倍，我们一般认为，可以将其看做是一个意志力的指示信号，这种意志力能够使孩子在学校乃至以后工作中的某个阶段受益。

为什么这个测试的意义如此重大甚至于可以预测一个人的未来呢？因为孩子们的决定和一种名叫「耐性」的指数密切相关，这个指数被大量父母们所忽视。

【难点】

第三段是一个长句

红色部分为主语从句
蓝色部分是主句中的状语 supposedly是一个副词，意思是据称，一般看来
绿色部分为定语从句，修饰先行词willpower
at campus and eventually at work在定语从句中充当状语
