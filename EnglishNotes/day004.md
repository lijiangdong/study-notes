# Never Give in

Almost a year has passed since I came down here at your Head Master's kind invitation in order to cheer myself and cheer the hearts of a few of my friends by singing some of our own songs.

自从我收到你们校长的邀请来庆祝我和我一些深入人心的朋友来唱我们自己的歌几乎已经过去一年了

The ten months that have passed have seen very terrible catastrophic events in the world---up and downs,misfortune---but can anyone sitting here this afternoon,this October afternoon, not feel deeply thankful for what has happened in the time that just passed and for the very great improvement in the position of our country and of our home?

在过去的十个月中我们看到了世界上非常可怕的灾难性事情，大起大落和一些不幸的事情，但是任今天晚上坐在这里的每一个人对于我们的祖国和家乡这么大的提高没有任何感激之情吗？

Why,when I was here last time we were quite alone,desperately alone,and we had been so for five or six months.We were poorly armed. We are not poorly armed today;but then we were very poor armed.We had the unmeasured menace of the enemy and their air attack still beating upon us,and you yourselves had had experienced of this attack; and I expect you are beginning to feel impatient that there has been this long lull with nothing particular turning up!

为什么呢，我上一次来到这里只有我一个人，而且已经是5，6个月之前了。我们曾经缺乏武器装备。我们现在依然也很缺乏武器装备。我们受到其他国家不断的恐吓，他们的飞机在我们天上攻击我们，你们自己也都遭受过很多次这样的攻击。我期望你开始为现在的没有发生任何事情的平静感觉到焦躁。

You cannot tell from appearances how things will go. Sometimes imagination makes things our far worse than they are; yet without imagination not much can be done.Those people who are imaginative see many more dangers than perhaps exist;certainly many more than will happen;but then they must also pray to be given that courage to carry this far-reaching imagination.
